**The 10 Best Exercises For Women, According To A Trainer**

Start, instead, by building a solid foundation, and for my female clients, that means focusing on their hip area and core, which includes your abs and back. These muscle groups combine to form the powerhouse of the female body, so any strength-building workout for women should target them both.

Focusing on the basics does NOT, however, mean you aren't going to get in a stellar workout. Some of the best exercises for women are foundational movements that will sculpt, strengthen, and challenge your total body big time just by using your own bodyweight.
So, if you're looking for a workout plan for women that is good for all levels and will help you get stronger from head to toe, master these exercises. As you get stronger, you can increase the challenge by adding weights into the mix. Start strength training three to five times per week and you'll be ready for power cleans and Turkish get-ups in no time!

Complete as many reps as possible, with control, in 30 seconds, then switch sides.

**Glute Bridge**

Engage abs, squeeze glutes, press into heels, and raise hips toward the ceiling until body forms one line from shoulders to knees. Hold the position for two seconds before lowering to start. That's one rep. Complete three sets of 10 reps.

Complete three sets of 10 reps per side without alternating.

**Military press**
How to: Start standing with feet shoulder-width apart, hands extended straight overhead, palms facing forward, with biceps by ears. (Note: You can use dumbbells for an added challenge.) Keeping back straight and core engaged, slowly lower arms by sides until elbows are bent at 90 degrees. Be sure to squeeze shoulder blades together at the bottom of this movement. Return to starting position. That's one rep. Complete three sets of 10 reps.
