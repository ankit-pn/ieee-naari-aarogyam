                            One of the biggest mistakes I see people make when starting to work out or jumping back into exercise after taking a break, is that they want to go right into the 2.0 level stuff they see people doing on Instagram or at the gym. They think that if it does not look like it will kill you, how can it make you stronger? The truth is, though, that you need to
                </p>
                <p>
                            learn how to plank before you burpee; otherwise you can hurt yourself or cause imbalances in your body.
                            Start, instead, by building a solid foundation, and for my female clients, that means focusing on their hip area and core, which includes your abs and back. These muscle groups combine to form the powerhouse of the female body, so any strength-building workout for women should target them both.
                </p>
                <p>
                            Focusing on the basics does NOT, however, mean you are not going to get in a stellar workout. Some of the best exercises for women are foundational movements that will sculpt, strengthen, and challenge your total body big time just by using your own bodyweight.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, if you are looking for a workout plan for women that is good for all levels and will help you get stronger from head to toe, master these exercises. As you get stronger, you can increase the challenge by adding weights into the mix. Start strength training three to five times per week and you will be ready for power cleans and Turkish get-ups in no time!

These are some of the best exercises for women, and as such, I would recommend performing this total-body workout two to three times per week. If you are looking for a longer workout, you can start the sequence over again from the top once you finish and repeat it one to two more times. Just make sure to rest for two to three minutes in between rounds.
